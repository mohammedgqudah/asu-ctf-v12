"""Challenge: Error Reporting  
Attack: Blind SQL Injection via logs side channel

By reviewing the provided code, youâ€™ll notice that the app exposes a `/logs` endpoint which displays application logs. There's also an apparent SQL injection vulnerability in the `/friend` (friend request) endpoint. However, this is a blind injection (the HTTP response is always the same), making boolean-based approaches ineffective.

Time-based extraction might come to mind, but the reverse proxy (NGINX) in front of the Flask app has a timeout, which makes that approach unreliable.

However, take a closer look at the logging behavior in the `/friend` endpoint:
```python
print(f"...Sending friend request to user {user[0]}")

log_per_user(session['username'], f'Friend request sent')
```
This log line is only triggered if the user exists and the query returns a row, because if there is no row, the expression `user[0]` will raise an Exception.

Now, you check one char at a time, and then check if a log was inserted in /logs or not, this becomes a simple error-based SQL injection challenge.
